# Studying data by practice in real world

In this repo you will find my studies about a `wild dataset`. This kind of self-named dataset are open and free datasets with real world information, but are not easily structured for a more deep analysis. This one comes from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/TGS00047/bookmark/table?lang=en&bookmarkId=49a5dc8a-5f88-4783-9d93-632f11df8d8d).

## What to do with this dataset?

The first problem with this dataset is the format, which is not friendly for a `pandas` structure, for example. The labels also are not self-explanatory.

For starters, we need to check the dataset source for the description.
