# Studying data by practice in real world

In this repo you will find my studies about a `wild dataset`. This kind of self-named dataset are open and free datasets with real world information, but are not easily structured for a more deep analysis. This one comes from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/api/dissemination/sdmx/2.1/data/tgs00047?format=SDMX-CSV&compressed=true).
