# Studying data by practice in real world

In this repo you will find my studies about a `wild dataset`. This kind of self-named dataset are open and free datasets with real world information, but are not necessarily easily structured for a more deep analysis. This one comes from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/TGS00047/bookmark/table?lang=en&bookmarkId=49a5dc8a-5f88-4783-9d93-632f11df8d8d).

## What is this dataset?

The file `tgs00047_tabular.tsv` has [tab-separated values](https://github.com/eBay/tsv-utils/blob/master/docs/comparing-tsv-and-csv.md). My first mission (and perhaps the easiest one) is to load it in a `pandas` dataframe.
